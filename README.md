# COVID-19-Spread-Simulator
The purpose of this Simulator is to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in specified countries.
For this matter create a sample  population of people according to the data provided.
This should be done according to the age structure in each country.
Then for each individual in the sample we run a simulation(Markov Chain) for a specific period of days(Start_date to End_Date).
The Markov Chain simulation should consider 5 states {"H", "S", "I", "M", "D"}.
At the end we need to accumulate data for each specified country and each date.
### Note:
